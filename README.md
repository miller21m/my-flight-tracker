<h2>Flight tracker</h2>

<p>I'm Michael and I'm an aviation geek, One of my favorite apps is "Flight radar" I can spend hours on hours searching for flights around the world, different aircraft, and airports.
I decided to combine both my passion for coding and aviation into this app.</p>

<p>As part of my full-stack studies, I build my personal  "flight-tracker", 
in this app, you can track real-time/ live flights around the world and searching for airports, and watch the arrival/departure time table.</p>
